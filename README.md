The program will print the list of cookies that appeared most frequently on a given day.

Setup: navigate to the folder containing .java file and place the CSV file

To run the program, navigate the terminal window to the correct file path of the .java file

enter javac MostActiveCookie.java to compile the program

enter java MostActiveCookie filename.csv -d yyyy-mm-dd





MostActiveCookie.java contains the program's logic to take in a CSV file along with a date and prints out the list of all cookies that appeared most often at that given date.

The MostActiveCookieTest.java contains test cases ranging from empty files to single most common cookies to multiple common cookies as well as same cookie appearing on different dates.

to run the test cases, just compile the program and run it with no extra inputs

javac MostActiveCookieTest.java

java MostActiveCookieTest

This program will display that it passed all test cases or will print out which test case it failed and exit early.
